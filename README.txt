About:
* This project demonstrates advanced knowledge of Python and the ability
  to integrate various APIs into one program.
* Similar to Apple's "Siri" and Amazon's "Alexa", this virtual assistant
  can answer different types of questions or perform tasks based on
  commands. In this version of the project, the user types the command
  or the question and the bot responds with text. In the other version of
  the project, the user speaks the command or the question, and the bot
  will say the response.


Setup:
1. Run the file named "setup.py". This file will install all necessary 
   libraries on your machine so that the bot can function. Make sure
   that all the libraries install successfully.
2. Run the file named "main.py" to communicate with the bot.
